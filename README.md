Basic Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression analysis using a dataset containing information about per capita income over several years.
The notebook walks through loading the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), fitting a linear regression model, and making predictions.

## Files

- `Linear_regression_1.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing all the code for the linear regression analysis.
- `data.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis (make sure to replace this with the actual filename if different).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure the dataset (`data.csv`) is in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the notebook (`Linear_regression_1.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to see the entire process.

## Notebook Content

The notebook contains the following sections:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - Necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building are imported.

2. **Loading Data**:
   - The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

3. **Data Exploration**:
   - Initial data inspection to understand the structure and summary statistics of the dataset.

4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data cleaning and preparation for analysis.

5. **Model Training**:
   - A linear regression model is fitted to the data.

6. **Making Predictions**:
   - Predictions are made using the trained model.

7. **Visualization**:
   - Scatter plot and regression line visualization.

8. **Model Parameters**:
   - Extracting the slope (m) and intercept (c) of the regression line.

9. **Future Predictions**:
   - Predicting future values using the regression model.

## Results

The notebook includes a scatter plot with a fitted regression line and predictions for future values. The model parameters (slope and intercept) are also displayed.
